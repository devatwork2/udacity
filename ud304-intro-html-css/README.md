Not Your Typical Intro to Web Dev

### Lesson 1 - From Design to Code
Diligently employ a code/test/refine strategy as you precisely and deliberately translate initial design documents into static web pages.   
You'll also investigate the Document Object Model (DOM) and its implications for web development.

### Lesson 2 - Your Own Framework
Take pride in creating and personalising your own multi-platform, responsive CSS framework for publishing your professional portfolio projects to the web.

### Lesson 3 - Learning and Using Bootstrap
Strategically investigate an existing professional CSS framework as you use it to build a website using responsive design principles while maintaining code readability.
